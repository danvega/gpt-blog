This is the source code for a tutorial where we ask Chat GPT to help us write a Spring Boot application.

Q: What are the list of steps needed to create a REST API in Spring Boot that talks to a database?
A: Here is a high-level list of steps to create a REST API in Spring Boot that talks to a database:

1. Set up a Spring Boot project with the necessary dependencies, such as Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, and a database connector.
2. Define the entity classes that map to the database tables.
3. Configure the data source and entity manager in the application properties or YAML file.
4. Create a repository interface that extends JpaRepository to perform CRUD operations on the entity classes.
5. Implement the REST API controllers using Spring MVC to handle HTTP requests and return responses.
6. Use the repository interface in the controllers to fetch or persist data to the database.
7. Run the application and test the API using a tool such as Postman.

Note: This is just a high-level overview and the exact steps may vary depending on the specific requirements and complexity of the API.
